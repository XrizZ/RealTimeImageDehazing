Real Time Image Dehzaing is the topic of my Diploma Thesis, written in 2011. In this work, I've created a meta analysis of existing work in the field and pick one image dehazing algorithm and increase its performance to real-time processing (25 fps+). No prior work achieved real time performance at the time. I'm planning on expanding this repository to include executable code in the future.

Recorded results of the modified algorithm with real-life data can be found here:
