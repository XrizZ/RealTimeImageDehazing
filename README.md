Real Time Image Dehzaing is the topic of my Diploma Thesis, written in 2011. In this work, I've created a meta analysis of existing work in the field and picked one image dehazing algorithm among them to develop further. The goal was to make it real-time, meaning that it could run live on consumer grade hardware of the time(25 fps+). No prior work achieved real time performance then. I'm planning on expanding this repository to include executable code in the future.

Recorded results of the modified algorithm with real-life data can be found here:
